Help with adding overlay on background images:

For all javascript help I used my class notes and recordings. I wanted to add an additional functionality of displaying if the tide was "mid-tide", "high tide", or "low tide" based on what was returned for tidal height, but i was having trouble getting that to work. If you could let me know where I went wrong and how to get this working I would really appreciate it!
